							<h1>I-STEM Hackathon</h1>
							<br>
							<b><h2>Our Idea</h2></b>
							<p class="major">One of the most fundamental problems of the visually impaired is navigation. Oblivious to their surroundings, it is a challenge for them to locate places without external aid. We strived to solve this problem with our Android app “Around me”.</p>
							<p class="major">The application senses beacons in its vicinity. If the user’s phone finds a beacon (using Bluetooth), he gets a voice message stating his location. We planned on extending this to also give him the directions, given his destination.</p>

								<p class="major">Link to our GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/GayathriVenkatesh/aroundMe">AroundMe</a></p>

							<p class="major">Overall, it was a very wholesome and enriching experience. Working with the visually impaired taught me about the various techniques they employ to perform their day to day activities. The industry professionals too gave us a lot of insight about current technologies and how to use them. The 24-hour hackathon was a great memory and I look forward to participating in I-STEM 2020.</p>
