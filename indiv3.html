							<b><h2>My Experience</h2></b>
							<p class="major">At the application stage, candidates were asked to vividly describe an idea for their upcoming project. I had chosen to develop a competitive pricing app - an application that shows prices, reviews and offers from various e-commerce sites like Amazon, Flipkart etc. I had heard that Ruby on Rails is one of the most convenient frameworks to build such applications, which is why I was keen on learning it.</p>
							<p class="major">Learn IT Girl introduced me to concepts like MVC architecture, web-scraping and database management systems. Also, one of the greatest advantages was receiving individual attention from the mentor, which helped us learn faster.</p>
							<p class="major">LITG was an amazingly fun and engaging experience for me. Working with a mentor taught me how to stick to deadlines, manage time efficiently and write clean code, to name a few. I must say that this program is a great initiative and I would love to be part of this community in the coming years.</p>
